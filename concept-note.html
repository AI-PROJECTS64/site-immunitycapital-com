      <h1>Concept Note — ImmunityCapital.com</h1>
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note summarises the idea behind <b>ImmunityCapital.com</b> and
        the types of programmes it can host. It is written for Boards, executive
        committees, public health leaders, Chief Risk / Medical / Sustainability
        Officers and impact investors considering acquiring the domain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1. What is “immunity capital”?</h2>
      <p>
        The expression <b>immunity capital</b> describes how immunity to infectious
        diseases can act as a form of capital in stratified societies.
        Historically, immunity (or the belief that someone was immune) has
        influenced access to jobs, credit, mobility and social status.
        Contemporary debates around COVID-19 and future pandemics show similar
        patterns, as vaccination status, prior infection or access to treatments
        can condition who is protected, who can work, travel or maintain income.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this perspective, <b>ImmunityCapital.com</b> is a <b>descriptive, neutral banner</b>
        for work on:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>mapping how immunity and protection are unequally distributed between and within countries;</li>
        <li>linking immunity to labour markets, income, social protection and resilience;</li>
        <li>designing policies, insurance solutions and investments that reduce protection gaps.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2. What ImmunityCapital.com is — and is not</h2>
      <h3>2.1 What it can host</h3>
      <p>
        The domain can serve as a neutral label for:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>Immunity Capital Observatory</b> tracking immunity inequalities and protection gaps across countries, regions or groups;</li>
        <li><b>Immunity Capital Index</b> combining epidemiological, socio-economic and social protection indicators into a synthetic score;</li>
        <li><b>Immunity Capital Lab</b> — a research and policy programme on immunity, work, precarity, race, gender and migration;</li>
        <li><b>Immunity Capital Impact Fund</b> or similar vehicles dedicated to global health equity and inclusive insurance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 What it is not</h3>
      <p>
        ImmunityCapital.com is <b>not</b>:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>a healthcare provider, hospital, clinic network or telemedicine platform;</li>
        <li>a triage or scoring engine for individual decisions in HR, banking, insurance or migration;</li>
        <li>a rating agency, label or certification on products, services or policies;</li>
        <li>a regulated insurance, reinsurance, asset management or investment service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The seller does not collect or process health data and does not provide
        medical, actuarial, legal, financial or tax advice. Any future use of the
        domain must be designed and operated under the acquirer’s own
        responsibility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3. Why ImmunityCapital.com matters (2025–2035)</h2>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 crisis highlighted how unequal access to vaccines,
        diagnostics and treatments compounds pre-existing inequalities in
        mortality, morbidity and economic vulnerability. Similar issues will
        arise with future pandemics and emerging infectious diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        For public institutions, insurers, reinsurers, investors and
        philanthropies, immunity capital offers:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>a way to <b>name and analyse</b> how health, work and income are linked;</li>
        <li>a framework for <b>measuring protection gaps</b> and prioritising resources;</li>
        <li>a narrative that connects pandemic preparedness, health equity and
            financial resilience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An exact-match <b>.com</b> domain gives this concept a stable, easily
        communicable home that can outlive any single project, institution or
        technology stack.

      <h2>4. Illustrative use cases</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Immunity Capital Observatory</h3>
      <p>
        A global or regional observatory hosted under ImmunityCapital.com could
        publish dashboards on vaccination coverage, access to treatments and
        primary care, social protection and insurance coverage, highlighting
        where immunity capital is weakest and protection gaps are largest.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Immunity Capital Index</h3>
      <p>
        A composite index could summarise immunity capital at country, city or
        regional level, supporting analysis by international organisations,
        development banks, cities, NGOs and impact investors.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Immunity Capital Lab</h3>
      <p>
        A multi-stakeholder lab could bring together universities, think tanks,
        public institutions, insurers and cities to study the intersections of
        immunity with work, precarity, race, gender and migration, and to
        co-design policies and products that reduce protection gaps.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 Immunity Capital Impact Fund</h3>
      <p>
        The domain could also front an impact fund investing in primary care,
        vaccine cold chains, digital health, inclusive insurance and other
        interventions that build immunity capital in under-served communities.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        All use cases are illustrative only and do not describe existing
        projects. They do not bind the seller in any way.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5. Legal, ethical and responsibility framework</h2>
      <p>
        The seller transfers only the <b>ImmunityCapital.com</b> domain name.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>No medical, scientific, actuarial, legal, financial or tax advice is provided.</li>
        <li>No health data is collected or processed by the seller.</li>
        <li>No regulated insurance, reinsurance or investment service is offered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The acquirer designs and operates any services, publications, indices,
        products or platforms under its own responsibility and must ensure
        compliance with all applicable frameworks (healthcare, data protection,
        non-discrimination, insurance, finance, labour, human rights, etc.).
